            3D animation “Assimilation and Accommodation, A Story of Bear” created by MAYA is the
            story about the transformation of a human-shaped bear into a human-shaped panda. <br>
            <br>
            In some Asian countries, pandas have been treated as a cute, peaceful, and popular animal while bears
            have an aggressive, strong, and violent impression. I consider being the same as the others, people
            sometimes call being “normal,” would be the easiest way to live. <br>
            <br>
            But I hate living in the way that the other people define I should be. Also, in some Asian countries, having lighter skin is
            one kind of beauty standards. There are some countries that even have skin bleach. <br>
            In contrast,
            however, you can view the story in a positive way. To give a neutral mood to the audience, I
            tried not to set the mood with facial expression, music, or colors. If you do not like how you look
            like, you can step out and partially change who you are, keeping your identity inside, just like
            people do makeup.

            <br> <br>In this story, putting white paint is the way to kill your uniqueness
            resembling the background. In other words, being the same color as the environment makes you
            transparent. Putting black paint is the way to have a different identity by caring for who you are
            expected by the others as well as hiding who actually you are. You could consider the white
            paint as water that washes who you are right now.
