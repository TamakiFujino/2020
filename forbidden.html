        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          When I decided to go to the US, the most concern my friends and family had was guns. <br>
          I came to the US in July in 2017 and after a few months, there was a mass shooting in Las Vegas with a numerous number of victims. <br>
          It has been two years, and more and more people have become the victim of mass shooting. <br>
          I wonder why it is so difficult to ban guns. <br>
          The sphere created with 9 sheets of collage of purple bullets is designed to create “allium”, which has another name “onion flower.” <br>
          I picked up allium as a main subject of this piece because its flower language in Japanese is deep sorrow while in English means prosperity.<br>
          There is a description in Bill of Rights: <br>
          <br>
          “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” <br>
          <br>
          This is the basic law that does not allow gun control. I wonder the government, society, or companies consider guns are the symbols of America’s or their prosperity, <br>
          not the tool that can take away a lot of people’s life at a moment.

Designer Baby / Gene Modification / Nurture Theory
</h5>
    <hr width=80%>
    <h6 style="text-align: left;">
      This piece is made based on the process of selective breeding of apple and the story of Adam and Eve in order to criticize gene modification and designer babies.<br>
         The idea of a designer baby is exactly the same idea as the selective breeding of apple to get sweeter, stronger, and more beautiful ones.<br>
        <br>
        Forbidden fruit often implies something you want to get more when you are prohibited to do so. <br>
        Gene modification has been criticized but always the field that human is so curious about. <br>
        Since I believe the nurture theory, the idea of a designer baby sounds crazy to me. <br>
        I put different color in the test tubes, and based on that color, the color of apple changes in this work. <br>
        <br>
        However, by making an apple shape out of my body, I want to reflect on myself more deeply about the topic. <br>
        What if gene modification could make me a better person physically and mentally? Do my kids in the future need that too?
