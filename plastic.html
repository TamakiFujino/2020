      Plastic Material is a virtual installation made with MAYA and body scan using Skanect and
Kinect.　<br>
<br>
 This work is based on the issue of plastic pollution in the ocean that is popularly talked
about among the younger generation right now. Taking advantage of plastic pollution in the ocean as the
topic of modern common knowledge of everyone, this piece questions the society with AI and
the identity of individuals in the system of capitalism and mass production. <br>
I put a body scan and
separated into body parts with textured with a package of brand logos that contribute to plastic
pollution the most. In the small black room with mirrored walls, you can flow with plastic waste
shaped body parts and think about the concept I talk about above. <br>
The surface of the ocean is set
as the level of your face, and that is something physical installation cannot put into practice. The
idea of setting the level of the surface of the ocean as the viewer’s perspective was inspired by
Up Against by Cheryl Pope and Eyes Wide Shut by Willy Verginer. <br>
The four walls of the room
are made out of mirrors so that the viewer can feel the ocean is infinite and they are a tiny
existence there. <br><br>
I was inspired by
the game, "Detroit, Become
Human." This game is created
based on the world that Androids
look identical to real humans and
they work for humans as if they are
slaves of humans. When Androids
start to have an emotion, they are
disposed of just like plastic waste.
If technology advanced much
more, and a similar society became
possible, would humans be
valuable? Even now, along with
the society with automation taking over our jobs and there are so many people that have similar skills and background. <br>
 <br>Would all
individuals be valuable? How much are we different from the plastic waste flowing in the sea that cannot be
distinguished individuals in the loop of being produced and wasted?

The society superfacially says that we are equal and they accept all the minorities, but economically, the minories need more efforts to be equal.
