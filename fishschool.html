<h6>The main concepts of my final project are identity and categorization. Since I moved to
the United States, I got to not be sure about who I am. I definitely think of myself as
Japanese, but when I go back to Japan or talk to my Japanese friends, I find myself
uncomfortable in understanding their ideas sometimes. My way of thinking got diverse; I
could say I got “Americanized.” However, I could be nobody but Japanese. Recently I
have been thinking who I am. People do not like being categorized, but at the same time,
people are scared of being completely different from other people. For example, in your
group exercise, when everyone except you supports the same idea, you would hesitate to
hold your idea and think you are wrong although there is not a right or wrong answer.
The shape of the object I would project map on represents a fish school. I heard that a fish
school always has the weakest and the other bully the weakest. When the weakest one
dies, the second weakest gets the weakest and got bullied. We don’t like something
different from the majority. We are all scared of being the one although we all hope to
have our own identity. If your own identity is completely the same as someone, then you
would lose the meaning of your existence.
I would explain individuals’ identities as colors on each triangle. At the start, the color of
triangles is all the same. Then one triangle becomes a different color, but the other color
does not accept that, and that triangle goes back to the original color which is the same as
everyone else. Some other individuals try to do the same thing but never get accepted.
Then when the one triangle changes to a different color, a different triangle become the
same color and find themselves it is okay to be a different color. And other triangles copy
that and get to have their own color.
Next, they start to categorize the color depends on how light it is or how warm it is, but
some triangles figure out that they do not fall into any categories, but it accepts that
situation. And all other triangles start to have their own color.
I would like to explain the narrative without any language. So, I would use sound effects
or music without lyrics and I would add an effect of kind of eye blinking on each triangle
to bring their emotions and their perspective.</h6>
