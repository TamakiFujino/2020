  <h6>I was born in 1998 in Osaka, Japan. <br>
          I spent 18 years of my life and moved to San Jose to study Art and English. <br>
          I am San Jose State University Digital Media Art BFA candidate in 2021.<br>
<br>
          I have two main inspiration of my work: researches of psychology and abstract concepts we cannot see physically but exist in every culture. <br>
          <br>
          Psychology has been my biggest interest more than digital media art. The interest comes from one notice when I was a kid;<br>
          "WHY AM I CRYING?" <br>
  <br>
          A baby does not have much understanding in emotion. Because they don't know the difference between sad, angry, jealous, and uncomfortable, <br>
          those emotion all come out as "crying" and that is why a baby cries a lot. <br>
          Even after I grew up to this age, I cannot bear crying when I see someone get extremely mad or I get scolded by someone, especilly by mother. <br>
          I am not sad, not mad, not scared, not uncomfortable, and then why I cry? I hate that that myself and ambiguous emotional state.<br>
          <br>
          Emotions are belong to us but I do not own them. I often do not know why I am having a certain emotion or do not know what the emotion is.<br>
          I guess it is because my branches of emotion have not developed enough, or I do not have enough vocabrary to describe this mind status? <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, I use my art to explore the unknown emotions within us and connection between them and the incidents that trigger them. <br>
          <br>
          Exploring the abstract concepts we cannot see physically but exist in every culture is a part of understanding unknow piece of myslef. <br>
          The examples would be "love" "god" "dream" "ghost" "lack" and "time." Those words can be traslated into almost all languages. <br>
          I am interested in those because those concept needed regardless any culture. Therefore, those are not cultural, geological, and racial. <br>
          This is purely about human, so I believe examining those would lead better understanding of human. <br>
          <br>
          My goal is to make the experience of your emotions are flooding out <br>
          and think what they are and why they appear, with AR created by projection mapping. <br>
