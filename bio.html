  <h6>I was born in 1998 in Osaka, Japan. <br>
          I spent 18 years of my life and moved to San Jose to study Art and English. <br>
          I am San Jose State University Digital Media Art BFA candidate in 2021.<br>
          
          I have two main inspiration of my work: researches of psychology <br>
          and abstract concepts we cannot see physically but exist in every culture. <br>
          <br>
          Psychology has been my biggest interest more than digital media art. <br>
          The interest comes from one notice when I was a kid. "WHY AM I CRYING?" <br>
  <br>
          A baby does not have much understanding in emotion. <br>
          Because they don't know the difference between sad, angry, jealous, and uncomfortable, <br>
          those emotion all come out as "crying" and that is why a baby cries a lot. <br>
          Even after I grew up to this age, I cannot bear crying <br>
          when I see someone get extremely mad or I get scolded by someone, especilly by mother. <br>
          I am not sad, not mad, not scared, not uncomfortable, and then why I cry? <br>
          <br>
          Emotions are belong to us but I do not own them. <br>
          I often do not know why I am having a certain emotion or do not know what the emotion is.<br>
          I guess it is because my branches of emotion have not developed enough, <br>
          or I do not have enough vocabrary to describe this mind status? <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, I use my art to explore the unknown emotions within us <br>
          and connection between them and the incidents that trigger them. <br>
          <br>
          Exploring the abstract concepts we cannot see physically but exist in every culture <br>
          is a part of understanding unknow piece of myslef. <br>
          The examples would be "love" "god" "dream" "ghost" "lack" and "time." <br>
          Those words can be traslated into almost all languages. <br>
          I am interested in those because those concept needed regardless any culture. <br>
          Therefore, those are not cultural, geological, and racial. <br>
          This is purely about human, so I believe examining those would lead better understanding of human. <br>
