        While she pursues a beauty of dancing, she confronts the forces of people against street culture.
        More than being a performer, then she found a meaning of being a director by learning technical and technology aspect of a stage,
        in order to elevate street culture as high as other performance arts such as ballet. <br>
        Exploring the possibilities of performance art, she found that art installation is a place where the viewers can be a part of artwork
        share the experience.

        <h4>About</h4>
        <hr width="80%">
        <h6>Her main inspirations are researches of psychology and abstract concepts we cannot see physically but exist in every culture.
        Psychology has been her biggest interest.
        She started being fascinated with psychology when she asked herself
        "Why am I crying?!"
        <br>
        <br>
        A baby does not have much understanding in emotions.
        Because they cannot distinguish the difference between sad, angry, jealous, umcomfortable, and any other emotions.
        Therefore, those emotion all come out as "crying" and that is why a baby cries a lot.
        Even after she grew up over twenty years old,
        she cannot bear crying when she sees someone gets extremely mad or she get scolded by someone, especilly by her mother.
        At that moment, she is not sad, mad, scared, or uncomfortable, and if so, why does she need to cry?
        She hates being in that ambiguous emotional state.
        <br>
        <br>
        Emotions come from inside of us but we do not own them. As a result, we can barely control them.
        We do not know exactly what the all emotions are and where they come from.
        She often does not know why she is having a certain emotion and does not know what the emotion is.<br>
        She considers it is because her branches of emotions have not developed enough just like a baby,
        or she does not have enough vocabrary to describe this mind status.
        Therefore, She uses her art to explore the unknown emotions within us
        and connection between them and the incidents that trigger them. <br>
        <br>
        Exploring the abstract concepts we cannot see physically but exist in every culture is also a part of understanding unknow piece of herself. <br>
        The examples would be "love" "god" "dream" "ghost" "luck" and "time." Those words can be traslated into almost all languages. <br>
        Therefore, those are not cultural, geological, and racial. They are purely about human; they exist within us,
        so She believes examining those would lead better understanding of human. <br>
        <br>
        Her goal is to make the experience of your emotions are flooding out and think what they are and why they appear.
        She is currently working on digital video, net art, 3D modeling, projection mapping, and sound visualization.
