    <div class="description">
      <p>It’s been over two years since I came to the United States and one biggest thing I have gotten in my perspective is categorization toward different groups of people. <br>
        I identify myself as Japanese and assume I could never be American. At the same time, however, when I go back to Japan, I always realize I am Americanized: <br>
<br>
how I think about myself and about other people. <br>

<br>
I know that I don’t have to identify myself as Japanese or American. I can say I am Japanese living in the US, <br>
but I don’t because I don’t feel comfortable identifying myself that way. <br>
A fish school has bullying as well as human. They always find the weakest fish and bully it. <br>
Even if the weakest was taken away from school, they are going to find another weakest and start bullying it. <br>
This only happens only when they are trapped in a very small world.<br>
I wonder we want to categorize people when we have a small perspective and do not feel comfortable to be different <br>
because being different makes you the target of being seen by the other disapprovingly. <br>
This piece is not about bullying; <br>
I would focus on why it is hard to be different from other people and being myself affects the other people to be able to represent their own identity.
