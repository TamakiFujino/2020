      This project starts with the critisizm towards awareness ribbon made by a comedian, George Denis Patrick Carlin. He critisized awarenessas as one of the form of "slacktivism." The term was created by combining slacker and activism. It is a term to explain superfacial activities that do not require money, time, and effort. Carlin even stated that the people who just put awareness ribbons should have brown-colored ribbon, indicating the color of poop, instead.

  As an artist, we often deal with social issue as the subject of work. Without a deep understanding of the issue, we would just use the issue just as the subject; it is almost a fascinating prey to artists. I have seen some of artwork taking a social issue got a lot of criticizm even though the artist is working on the issue with a strong passion. This piece was installed in the Art Building of San Jose State Univeristy. I would like to see the future artists to be away from slacktivism because art has such a big power to change the world.
