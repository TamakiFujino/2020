        <p> Slacktivism / Awareness Ribbon </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          This project starts with the critisizm towards awareness ribbon made by a comedian, George Denis Patrick Carlin.
          He critisized awarenessas as one of the form of "slacktivism." The term was created by combining slacker and activism.
          It is a term to explain superfacial activities that do not require money, time, and effort.
          Carlin even stated that the people who just put awareness ribbons should have brown-colored ribbon,
          indicating the color of poop, instead.<br>
          <br>
          As an artist, we often deal with social issue as the subject of work. Without a deep understanding of the issue,
          we would just use the issue just as the subject; it is almost a fascinating prey to artists.
          I have seen some of artwork taking a social issue got a lot of criticizm even though the artist is working on the issue with a strong passion.
          This piece was installed in the Art Building of San Jose State Univeristy.
          I would like to see the future artists to be away from slacktivism because art has such a big power to change the world. <br>
