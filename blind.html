      <p>This piece was inspired by the movie, "Birdbox," on Netflix. After watching the movie, I realized that we depend on too much visual information and are actually blind because we cannot get away from it. I used bubble wrap which we use only to wrap something. The use is temporary, and we really donâ€™t pay attention. I made braille by putting silicone into each bubble and made an message that can be understandable only by the people who are blind or know how to read.

"I am not bound by the assumptions of the sighted or their assumed limits. Sighted people don't help me make the art. I am a visual person. I just can't see," -- by Pete Eckert, a blind photographer.
