      Encircle is a distributable 3D object created with MAYA.<br>
       Compared to the regular production in a factory, the advantages of using 3D printing are distributable, savable data online, modifiable scale, and adjustable amount of production. More than that, it is also recyclable. <br>
       Initially, I had an idea to 3D print a business card because nowadays people usually scan and save business cards digitally so physical business cards are needed only when they exchange them. <br>
       Exchanging them physically would not be faded out even after digital technology takes over our lives because passing a business card is a form of greeting. <br>
       The material of 3D printing is recyclable, so I consider a business card would be a great object to use 3D print because they are actually needed for a minute when exchanging. <br>
       <br>
       People can download the file, print out at home with their information, then the others who received one can reuse it after scanning them. <br><br>

       I expanded the idea and created a thin triangle piece that has joints on each edge. It is scalable based on your needs, so you can create any object by printing them as much as you need to create the object. It could be 2D objects such as business cards and also 3D objects. <br>
       <br>
       That could be anything using your creativity. <br>
       The challenge I had in the process of modeling is to create a simple joint that is flexible to both any 2D and 3D objects. By using Encircle, you can recycle processes within your home. For example, if you need a vase, instead of going to Amazon, you can print out pieces of Encircle and build a vase with your creativity. When you move out, you can separate them and in a new house, you can rebuild something new such as a photo frame. <br>
       <br>Also, another purpose of this piece is when an emergency happens because of a natural disaster, you can take apart pieces from the object you have been using and build something necessary such as slippers, toilets, or just plates to eat food.

Encircleは3Dプリントすることによって配布可能な物体です。工場などでの通常の生産に比べて、
3Dプリントを使うことで物体を生産することのいい点は、<br>
3Dプリンターさえあれば、誰でも手にいれることができること、オンラインに物体のデータを保存しておけること、用途に合った大きさに変更するのが簡単であること、また工場で発注する場合、一気に大きな数を注文しなければいけないのに対し、生産の数を自由に選択できることです。
