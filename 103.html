  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Oil and Water (2018)</h2>
    <h5>Digital Video, 2min 33sec</h5>
    <hr><br>
    <h5> Generation Gap / Cultural Gap / Tattoo / Conflict</h5><hr>
    <p style="font-size:20px; width:80%; margin: auto;">
      This piece is made based on the story when I left Japan about three years ago.
  This piece mainly about the generation and cultural conflict, talking about myself planning to get a tattoo of the favorite flower of my grandmother. The conflict explained as oil and water in the video.
On the day I left Japan, it was early morning, and my grandma has a little garden she built in the backyard. And there was A queen of the night, which is her favorite flower.<br>
This flower only blooms only a few hours in the early morning, but the flower bloomed on the day I left Japan. She was crying and she said it bloomed to celebrate my new start in the US. <br>
After that, I wanted to get a tattoo of a queen of the night because I want to show her my gratitude and also being afraid of losing her. <br>
But I know that in Japan, especially for the older generations like my grandma, getting a tattoo is a huge no-no. So, I texted her, telling I want to get a tattoo because it is your favorite flower, and want to keep you or my memories with you on my body forever.
<br> To the text, she was upset and said she would never accept that. So the text of the video is based on that text. So, this piece is about the cultural and generational difference in how you express love.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">10 Digits (2020)</h2>
    <h5>Coding Art - Created with MAX MSP</h5>
    <hr><br>
    <h5> Idenitification / Digital Era / Phone number</h5>
    <hr><br>
    <p style="font-size:20px; width:80%; margin: auto;">
      This piece is created with MAX MSP, inspired by CV Dazzle by Adam Harvey. Harvey created various make-ups to "escape" from facial recognition.
      <br><br>
      Nowadays, companies and Social Media recognize you as you are not your name nor face. Whenever you register or make any contract, you need phone number.<br>
      The 10 digit numbers assigned randomly by the cell phone company is the biggest identification of us.<br>
      <br>
      The 10 digit numbers travel somewhere I have no ideas about, and exist as if they are me. <br>
      When you put your phone number, there will appear a filter based on your number on your face as if like your phone number hide and distort your face. <br>
      Who are we in this digital world?

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">E-portfolio (2020)</h2>
    <hr><br>
    <p style="font-size:20px; width:80%; margin: auto;">
      I developed my front page of e-portfolio over the summer. I wanted to create a page that represents myself and my concepts well.
      First, rain is a huge thing for me because rain can be interpreted in different ways. Says that rain is often used as a symbol of sadness, but at the same time,
      rain is hope because it is something necessary for any kind of living species. So, I often use rain as the representation of having multiple aspects on one theme. <br>
      Also, there's an argument about nature or nurture theory, and I believe in nurture theory. So, to me education is everything. <br>
       Rain represents something washing or polishing your mind or way of thinking. That's the reason why I use rain as the main concept here. <br>
      <br>
      For the text, it is in Japanese, but saying "Be noisy while you are alive." Interesting thing is that Japanese has three characters, Kanji (Chinese characters), Hiragana, and Katakana.<br>
      In this text, those three Chinese characters mean flies as a noun. But when it becomes a verb it means being noisy. Also, it has the meaning of persisting one's opinion and is having too great abilities. <br>
      I wish, as an artist, I want to keep speaking up about what we need to talk about. Also, I want to keep creating something to amaze people.
